# Udemy-react-projects
This is a repository containing all the React Practice files and small Projects I've created while working on my React Udemy Course.

To access the projects and assignments go over to branch. There you'll see all the assignments in their own branches. Each branch contains HTML, CSS, JS Code and the React Componenets.
